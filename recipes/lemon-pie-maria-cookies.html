    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lemon Pie with Maria Cookies is a refreshing and sweet dessert that's simple to make and perfect for any occasion. The crust is made with Maria cookies, a popular type of biscuit, which adds a subtle sweetness and a crunchy texture.</p>
    <p>The filling is a creamy and tangy lemon mixture that balances the sweetness of the crust. It’s a no-bake dessert, making it a convenient option for a quick yet delicious treat.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of Maria cookies (about 200g)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 can (395g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream (whipped)</li>
        <li>Fresh lemon slices for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the crust:</strong> Crush the Maria cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or a rolling pin. Mix the crumbs with the melted butter until everything is well coated. Press the mixture into the bottom of a pie dish to form an even crust. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Stir until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Whip the cream:</strong> In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the lemon mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the pie:</strong> Once the crust is set, pour the lemon filling over the chilled crust and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li><strong>Chill the pie:</strong> Refrigerate the pie for at least 3 hours, or until the filling is firm.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh lemon slices if desired, and serve cold.</li>
    </ol>
