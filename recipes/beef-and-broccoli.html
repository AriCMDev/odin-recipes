    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Beef and Broccoli is a delicious and popular Chinese dish known for its tender beef and vibrant broccoli, all coated in a savory, slightly sweet sauce. This stir-fried dish is quick and easy to make, perfect for a weeknight dinner.</p>
    
    <p>The beef is thinly sliced and stir-fried until it's just cooked, while the broccoli remains crisp and bright. The sauce, typically made with soy sauce, garlic, and a bit of ginger, ties everything together for a flavorful and satisfying meal.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb flank steak or sirloin, thinly sliced against the grain</li>
        <li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for stir-frying)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth or water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Prepare the ingredients:</strong> Slice the beef thinly against the grain. Wash and chop the broccoli into small florets. Mince the garlic and ginger.</li>
        <li> <strong>Blanch the broccoli:</strong> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the broccoli florets and cook for 1-2 minutes until bright green. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li> <strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornstarch, beef broth (or water), brown sugar, and sesame oil. Stir until the cornstarch is fully dissolved.</li>
        <li> <strong>Stir-fry the beef:</strong> Heat a large pan or wok over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil. Once hot, add the sliced beef in batches, cooking until browned, about 2-3 minutes per batch. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li> <strong>Stir-fry the garlic and ginger:</strong> In the same pan, add the minced garlic and ginger. Cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li> <strong>Combine beef and broccoli:</strong> Add the cooked beef and broccoli to the pan, then pour in the sauce. Toss everything together and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and coat the beef and broccoli evenly.</li>
        <li> <strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot over steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
